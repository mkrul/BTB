      content="Proponents of breed-specific legislation (BSL) argue that certain dog breeds should be banned or regulated based on statistical data surrounding dog attacks. The most commonly targeted breeds are those labeled pit bulls. Many people use pit bull as an umbrella term for dogs with certain physical characteristics, such as a muscular build and a short coat, and breed bans often target individual dogs based on their appearance. This project aims to measure the accuracy of visual breed identification, as well as how different groups of people identify dogs as pit bulls, taking their personal biases into account. This assessment is intended to provide participants with an opportunity to learn more about the limitations of visual breed identification, as well as how individual biases can influence the way that we perceive dogs. This test is designed to measure how accurately pit bulls can be identified based on observed physical characteristics. The assessment relies on how individual participants classify pit bulls according to breed makeup, as well as the amount of pit bull DNA present in a dog's genetic profile. Data used in this assessment were gathered at random from public sources. Some of the companies that provide DNA testing services for dogs include Embark, Wisdom Panel, DNA My Dog, and Orivet. Because Embark is widely considered to be one of the most accurate DNA test kits for dogs, this project will use Embark's results to compare against visual breed identifications. DNA testing can only detect breeds that are present in a dog's immediate ancestry, and ancestors more than four generations back may not be detected at all. The accuracy of DNA tests can also vary significantly between different companies and tests. Additionally, some breeds can be especially difficult to distinguish from one another due to their common ancestry. For example, the genetic profiles of the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier are very similar, as they are closely related breeds. This project was developed for educational and entertainment purposes by a private third party and is not a part of any official government or academic research. It is not affiliated with Embark or any other DNA testing service. The results of this test are not intended to promote any specific breed or type of dog."
